## Colorfield

The colorfield component is highly specific to the needs of the design system pages. It is used to allow a user to choose a color and compute an output from it.

- The input area always displays the selected color as a background, the text color will always contrast the selected color. The styles should otherwise mimic button styles except for font, which will inherit from the body and not change case.
- The final value can either be a color (which should be colored in a similar way to the input) or a single value with no color applied. The styles should balance with the input in terms of spacing and alignment.
- While only the input area may look interactive, the entire component can be tapped to change the value of the input.
- The delta between the input and value is never a color but instead a represented difference between the input and the final value.
- Labels should be all uppercase, medium weight, and .9rem from the root font size to counteract the change in case.
- All other text should match body font properties. 
- When the horizontal layout will not fit inside of its container, each part will stack vertically. Label first then the display below.

To achieve the layout shifting when the component is too wide for its container, the [Fab Four technique](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-fab-four-technique-to-create-responsive-emails-without-media-queries-baf11fdfa848/) is used. This snaps the width at container breakpoints by forcing negative widths to refer to a minimum width.
