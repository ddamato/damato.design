## Button

Buttons are a quintessential part of every design system as they invoke the user to take an action. 

### Default button
The default button is provided without standout colors as the use is expect to target anciliary actions beyond primary and secondary buttons. This also designed to all buttons uses the default styles as a base to keep them consistent. The further variations of the button will come from additional attributes.

### Primary Button
The primary button should be designed to draw attention to the action.

<blu-button selfdocument type="primary">Primary Button</blu-button>

### Secondary Button
The secondary button should only be used along side a primary button when a second choice is available to the user.

### Disabled Button
The disabled state of the button reduces the opacity and sets the mouse cursor to show a disabled state.
