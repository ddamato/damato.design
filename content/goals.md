## goals

### Hyper pattern reuse
In designing a system, some patterns are decided in isolation. A goal of this system is to attempt to reuse patterns in order to reduce the amount of deviations of design/code. This will also help maintain a consistent user experience. This is especially apparent in the components featured here, where they will differ slightly by type and function but are otherwise using similar styles.

### Self-documentation
When designing/engineering a new pattern or component, the creative process exists in one context while documenting that result exists in another. This is especially the case for the world of design applications where designers may either type in another layer within the artboard or take screenshots for a content management system. This system will attempt to either provide solutions to self-document or methods to make documentation more efficient. For example, each component blueprint self-documents the code used below the component example. This keeps the example code up-to-date with the example.
