## Goals
The following statements attempt to justify the purpose of an endeavour in architecting a design system without a product or business to support.

### None of your business
This design system aims to explore what a offering may include without a business or feature initiative; focusing on simple solutions with thoughtful design and inclusive technologies. This hones a focus on curating only exactly what the system needs without needing to ask if it belongs in the system or not. It exists, therefore it is.

### The proof is in the programming
This design system has a source of truth designed first in code instead of a traditional or industry standard application (eg. [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)). This realizes the potential as a fully-functional experience opposed to a partially-interactive artboard concept.

### Go ahead, make my documentation
This design system will make attempts to explore methods where documentation is maintained effortlessly or automatically for both designers and engineers in mediums they are familiar with. It should explore the possibility of becoming self-aware of gaps that require more clarity.
