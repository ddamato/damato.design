## Goals

### None of your business
This design system aims to explore what an overall system might offer without a business initiative; focusing on simple solutions with thoughtful design and inclusive technology.

### The proof is in the program
This design system has a source of truth designed using code instead of application such as Sketch or Figma. This realizes the potential as a fully-functional experience opposed to a partially-interactive artboard concept.

### Go ahead, make my documentation
This design system will make attempts to explore methods where documentation is maintained effortlessly or automatically for both designers and engineers in mediums they are familiar with.
