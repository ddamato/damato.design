## Curation

### Spacing

Unlike color and typography, spacing has been curated without a separate layer of locative token values. This is because the spacing values will not only affect the components but also how the components are arranged on the page. There is no conceivable method to generally define where these spacing values would be applied outside of the component library.

### Elevation

The design system has simplified the concept of elevation is a very selective manner. Dropdown components do not flyout from the layout and therefore do not present themselves as elevated. The system has no modals; all content is inline with the current focus for the user. For this site in particular, elevation only occurs in mobile, to display the list of navigational menu items over the content when the user opens the menu.
