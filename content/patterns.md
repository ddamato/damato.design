# Your best **behavior**

The following is a collection of patterns that describe standards and conventions which provide the rules that help govern content within the design system. Localization must be kept in mind while thinking of these patterns as some might be altered to support other cultural expectations.

### Localization
Curating patterns to your user's cultural expectations will always provide a better experience. However, knowing all the distinctions between groups of people and their behaviors are very challenging. The sections below attempt to call out some expected differences in behavior. Examples are often tagged with a language and country combination which identifies a certain content format for the provided locale.

The table below has a list of most of the possible combinations. The list is also available as a [json file](json/isoLanguageCountryCodes.json).
