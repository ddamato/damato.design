# With flying **colors**

Color is a strategic part of this design system, primarily arranged by someone with a color-deficiency with help along the way from expert resources and mathematic formulas. The efforts in defining the color system establish a disciplined collection of thoughtfully curated colors and ways to use them inclusively.

This page aims to outline [what colors were chosen](#design-tokens "DAMATO Design, Color Tokens"), [how they were chosen](#curation "DAMATO Design, Color Curation"), and [why they were chosen](#usability "DAMATO Design, Color Usability").
