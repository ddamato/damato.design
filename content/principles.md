## priniciples

### Consistency
Whatever design, pattern, or value that is decided should be considered for use across the system; not in the initial place that it was considered. Ensuring that parts of the system look and work similarily maintains integrity so the user trusts the application's workflow throughout. If the user came upon a piece of the workflow that didn't adhere to what they percieve as part of the application; that trust is lost.

### Inclusivity
It is important to consider all users when designing/engineering a design system. The design system will aim to highlight and use standards in accessibility and localization throughout.
