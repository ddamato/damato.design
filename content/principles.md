## Priniciples
These design principles are intended to help guide important directions this design system takes in its growth.

### All users are important
Consider everyone when creating or modifying the experience. Reference standards in accessibility and localization to provide a fully usable experience to all. Consider not only the users but also their technology. 

### Keep consistency
Ensure that the parts of the system belong together in design and engineering. A user within an experience will trust a system that seems connected over one with uncanny parts.

### Refrain from reinvention
Use designs, patterns, or elements that users are familiar with. Curb identity in favor of a usable experience. Add personality appropriately.

### Content-first
Decisions around layout and composition should consider different types of content attributes and how those decisions will eventually propogate to the device's viewable area.
