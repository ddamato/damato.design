# design **delightful** systems

Hello, welcome to the **DAMATO** Design System!

Architected by [Donnie D'Amato](https://donniedamato.info), he has built and maintained design systems for [large](https://www.compass.com) [companies](https://www.godaddy.com) by being an active liasion between the product design and engineering teams.

His interest in design systems comes from a curiousity of how the entire system is viewed by the user; how they respond and interact with it.
