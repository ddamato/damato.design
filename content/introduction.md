Donnie has built and maintained design systems for [large](https://www.compass.com "Compass Real Estate") [companies](https://www.godaddy.com "GoDaddy") by being an active liasion between the product design and engineering teams. He has interdisplicinary skills in both art and technology which help craft solutions for different needs.
