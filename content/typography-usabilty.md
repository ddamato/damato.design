## Usability

In terms of accessibility, thereâ€™s no official enforced minimum size by itself. It is common for accessibility measurements to include [color](/color#usability) and other properties to determine whether text is deemed accessible. A good baseline is recommended to [set at 16px](https://accessibleweb.com/question-answer/minimum-font-size/), but more specifically [set to the browser's default](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-font-sizing-explained/). We ensure that the user can modify the font size in their device's user settings to affect the readability as necessary. Font sizes are set in relative "rem" units; relative to the "root" (ie. page) font size so this can scale appropriately.

Selecting the proper font face is also important to readability. The [Jost*](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html) font family was selected as geometric fonts are of "Humanist construction".

> These are beautiful and legible fonts, designed to perfection. _[Eugene Sadko, Guide to 10 font characteristics and their use in design](https://medium.com/@eugenesadko/guide-to-10-font-characteristics-and-their-use-in-design-b0a07cc66f7)_

Additionally, many of the guidelines on accessible text found in the article _[The controversy of accessible type](https://medium.com/queer-design-club/the-controversy-of-accessible-type-8def04eb8808)_ have been followed.

- Text is aligned in one direction throughout.
- Weights and styles are used for specific purposes.
- Typeface is clean and distinguishable.
- Spacing within body text is 1.5x, between sections of text at 2x.

### All caps
[Many recommendations in accessibility](https://github.com/humanmade/hm-pattern-library/issues/75) make mention to refrain from having text in all caps. This seems to be specifically when reading bodies of text. The areas where all caps is used throughout this system are done in order to [slow the user down](https://www.mity.com.au/blog/writing-readable-content-and-why-all-caps-is-so-hard-to-read) to read the label or action before continuing. This delays an important message to [let the user think](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/friction-ux-design-tool/) for a moment about how to continue.
