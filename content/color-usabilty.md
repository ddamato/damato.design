## Usability

In choosing colors, accessibility must be a priority. With the layout colors selected at opposite ends of the scale, this ensures that if a gray on one side appears as text on top of a gray on the other side. The text _should_ pass accessibility standards (assuming the font size is appropriate). Accent colors are then chosen from a predetermined list and then reviewed for accessibility measurements and were considerate to not be based on cultural expectations.

### WCAG accessible text

While there are now [different standards between AA and AAA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) which also relate to font size, a general rule is to ensure a 4.5:1 contrast ratio between the background color and text. Throughout the site, this ratio is typically much higher. You can use the colorfield control below to test the ratio between a chosen text color and the current background color of the site. This should also update when changing the system color.

The process in creating this functionality is outlined in the article _[Building your own color contrast checker](https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/building-your-own-color-contrast-checker-4j7o)_ which also explains the calculations involved to determine the ratio.

This isn't enough to simply select a high contrast between the background and text. Certain contrasts cause [Irlen Syndrome](https://irlen.com/what-is-irlen-syndrome/) which some people perceive the text to move on the page due to contrast sensitivity. The contrast between grayscale steps was adjusted to mitigate this.

The research explained in _[Designers should avoid pure black typography â€” but which dark gray should we use?](https://uxdesign.cc/designers-should-avoid-pure-black-typography-but-which-dark-gray-should-we-use-2d7faa07083a)_ provides insight that `hsl(0, 0, 15%)` was a contrast that reduced the effect of moving text. This value was a target when crafting the formula to step the grayscale.

### Accent colors

The colorfield component above provides the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance on Wikipedia") between the chosen color and a color from the list.

This tool was used to select the accent colors on the site that were close to desired hues. Admittedly, the accent colors selected for the site _do not_ meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio for both the light and dark themes and therefore you will find the majority of text is not given an accent color _unless_ it is actionable. Actionable text styles has been modified to increase legibility to allow for accent colors to be used in these locations.

The article _[Which Colors Look Good on Black and White?](https://dev.to/finnhvman/which-colors-look-good-on-black-and-white-2pe6)_ ends with a list of colors however, it would appear that these colors are _only_ for black and white. Additionally, a post within the UX Stack Exchange also asks for a _[Background colour suitable for both black and white text](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/73763/background-colour-suitable-for-both-black-and-white-text)_ with [an answer](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/73763/background-colour-suitable-for-both-black-and-white-text "Answer: Background colour suitable for both black and white text") providing a link to a much larger table of colors. That link is broken however, there is a  [backup](https://maswildan.wordpress.com/2016/08/28/color-contrast-on-blackwhite-background/ "mas wildan WordPress site"). This is a [json file](json/a11yColorsOnBlackAndWhite.json "Accessible colors on black and white .json") with the referenced colors. Those colors are loaded into the colorfield component and the accent colors were chosen from this set.

Unlike many other systems, **no color is selected to represent something good or bad**. [Different colors mean different things to different cultures](https://uxplanet.org/understanding-color-psychology-though-culture-symbolism-and-emotion-215102347276 "Medium: Understanding color psychology though culture, symbolism, and emotion"). This could be rectified with localized color theming with a large effort for coverage or by choosing not including color as status. The system expects to use other patterns to help guide the user in understanding a meaning of state.
