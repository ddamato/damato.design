## Usability

Interactive elements are given at least 1rem (16px) of surrounding padding to provide a large target area. This includes page links, which are provided a negative margin to offset the larger size within bodies of text.

Without enough space between interactive elements, it will make it more difficult for users to accurately press the intended targets. [The average adult finger pad size is about .5in / 10mm wide](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/61606/spacing-between-ui-components "UX Stack Exchange Answer: Spacing between UI components"), so the provided default spacing between and around elements accounts for this.
